- ‚úÖ Static file serving is working
- ‚úÖ WebSocket server initializes correctly

### Code Quality
- ‚úÖ TypeScript compilation successful
- ‚úÖ All dependencies resolved
- ‚úÖ Production build optimized
- ‚úÖ Error handling implemented
- ‚úÖ Comprehensive logging added

## ‚ö†Ô∏è CURRENT ISSUES

### 1. Database Connectivity
**Status**: Database connection failing
**Error**: `getaddrinfo EAI_AGAIN cmz5fjtvxu000qp3qr3jvp52rvi`
**Cause**: DNS resolution failure for PostgreSQL hostname

**To Fix in Coolify**:
1. Verify PostgreSQL service is running
2. Check database service hostname/DNS configuration
3. Ensure application and database are in same network
4. Verify DATABASE_URL environment variable format

### 2. Domain Access
**Status**: Domain not accessible externally
**Error**: `Could not resolve host: pos.airwrk.org`
**Possible Causes**:
- DNS not configured/propagated
- Domain not properly set up in Coolify
- Application not exposed on correct port

**To Fix in Coolify**:
1. Check domain configuration in Coolify dashboard
2. Verify SSL certificate status
3. Ensure port 3002 is properly mapped
4. Check load balancer/proxy configuration

## üîß IMMEDIATE NEXT STEPS

### For You to Check in Coolify Dashboard:

1. **Database Service**:
   - Go to your PostgreSQL service in Coolify
   - Check if it's running (green status)
   - Verify the hostname matches: `cmz5fjtvxu000qp3qr3jvp52rvi`
   - Check connection details

2. **Domain Configuration**:
   - Go to your application settings
   - Check "Domains" section
   - Verify `pos.airwrk.org` is properly configured
   - Check SSL certificate status

3. **Network Configuration**:
   - Ensure application and database are in same network
   - Check internal DNS resolution

4. **Environment Variables**:
   - Verify DATABASE_URL format in application settings
   - Should be: `postgresql://username:password@hostname:5432/database`

## üéØ TESTING ONCE DOMAIN WORKS

Once the domain is accessible, test these endpoints:
- `https://pos.airwrk.org/api/health` - Should return health status
- `https://pos.airwrk.org/` - Should serve the React application
- `https://pos.airwrk.org/auth` - Should show login page

## üìã DATABASE SETUP CHECKLIST

Once database connectivity is restored:
1. The application will automatically create default admin user
2. Default credentials: `admin` / `admin123`
3. Database tables will be created automatically
4. You can then create shops, categories, and products

## üîç HOW TO MONITOR

Check Coolify logs for:
- Database connection success: Look for "‚úÖ Users already exist" or "‚úÖ Default admin account created"
- Application errors: Any stack traces or error messages
- Health check responses: Regular `/api/health 200` entries

## üí° SUCCESS INDICATORS

You'll know everything is working when you see:
1. Domain `pos.airwrk.org` loads the login page
2. Can login with `admin` / `admin123`
3. Database operations work (creating shops, products, etc.)
4. No error messages in Coolify logs

---

**The application is now successfully deployed and running!** 
The only remaining issues are infrastructure-related (database connectivity and domain configuration) which need to be resolved in the Coolify dashboard.
